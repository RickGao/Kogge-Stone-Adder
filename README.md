Explanation: Kogge-Stone Adder Design

The **Kogge-Stone Adder** is a type of parallel prefix adder that efficiently computes binary addition by reducing the propagation delay typically associated with ripple-carry adders. Its design is based on a prefix tree structure, allowing multiple stages to compute carry signals concurrently, which significantly reduces delay.

Key Components

1. **Generate Signal**: Determines whether a bit position generates a carry, regardless of any carry from the lower bits.  
   Gen[i] = A[i] & B[i]  
   If both A and B have a value of 1 at a specific bit position, this bit will generate a carry for sure.

2. **Propagate Signal**: Determines whether a bit position propagates an incoming carry to the next higher bit.  
   Pro[i] = A[i] ^ B[i]  
   If either A or B at this bit position is 1, then it will propagate a carry from the previous bit to the next.

3. **Prefix Tree Structure**: Carries are computed through multiple layers, where each layer combines previous generate and propagate signals, allowing the carry to reach the highest bit in log₂(N) stages (for N-bit addition). Each layer covers an exponentially larger range, ultimately ensuring every bit has the correct carry value.

   For each layer, k takes values 1, 2, 4, ..., 2^m:  
   - Gen[i] = Gen[i] ∣ (Pro[i] & Gen[i - k])  
     This indicates whether Gen[i] should be set to 1 due to carry propagation from bit i - k.
   - Pro[i] = Pro[i] & Pro[i - k]  
     This indicates whether the carry at bit i - k can propagate to bit i.

4. **Final Sum Calculation**: The sum for each bit is calculated as:  
   S[i] = Pro[i] ^ C[i-1]  
   where C[i-1] is the carry from the previous stage.

The result is a highly efficient adder with a fast carry propagation path, which enables binary addition with minimal delay.
