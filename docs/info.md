## How it works

This project implements a simple 4-bit Kogge-Stone Adder, a parallel-prefix adder designed to speed up binary addition by efficiently handling carry propagation. The adder uses generate and propagate signals to quickly compute the sum and carry-out.

## How to test

1. Provide two 4-bit binary numbers as inputs.
2. The output will give the sum of these numbers, along with the carry-out bit.

## External hardware

No external hardware is required for this project.
